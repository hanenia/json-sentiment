      "Her pale and argent body undisturbed,\n",
      "And paddled with the polished throat, and pressed\n",
      "His hot and beating heart upon her chill and icy breast.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was as if Numidian javelins\n",
      "Pierced through and through his wild and whirling brain,\n",

      "The sign which shipmen say is ominous\n",
      "Of wrath in heaven, the wan stars were dim,\n",

      "\n",
      "Down the steep rock with hurried feet and fast\n",
      "Clomb the brave lad, and reached the cave of Pan,\n",

      "And leapt upon a grassy knoll and ran\n",
      "Like a young fawn unto an olive wood\n",
      "Which in a shady valley by the well-built city stood;\n",
      "\n",
      "And sought a little stream, which well he knew,\n",

Use this function to print the polarity scores (with the name of the song) of the three files you created in question 3.  Does the reported polarity match your understanding of the song's lyrics? Why or why not do you think that might be?  Answer the questions in either a comment in the code cell or a markdown cell under the code cell."
