Paroles de la chanson I Wanna Dance With Somebody par Whitney Houston
Clock strikes upon the hour
and the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
how to chase my blues away

I've done alright up till now
it's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls
loneliness calls

Oh I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody

Yeah I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

I've been in love
and lost my senses
spinning through the town
Sooner or later the fever ends
and I wind up feeling down

I need a man who'll take a chance
on a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
my lonely heart calls

Oh I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
(Somebody who somebody who)somebody who loves me
(Somebody who somebody who)to hold me in his arms
I need a man who'll take a chance
on a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
my lonely heart calls

Oh I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody

With somebody who loves me
Yeah
Don?t you wanna dance with me baby
Don?t you wanna dance with me boy
Don?t you wanna dance with me baby

with somebody who loves me

don't you wanna dance
say you wanna dance
don't you wanna dance... x3
uh-huh
with somebody who loves me
