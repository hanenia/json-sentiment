Paroles de la chanson To Love You More par Céline Dion
Take Me Back Into The Arms I Love

Need Me Like You Did Before

Touch Me Once Again

And Remember When

There Was No One That You Wanted More



Don't Go You Know You Will Break My Heart

Won't Love You Like I Will

Love The One Who'll Stay

When She Walks Away

And You Know I'll Be Standing Here Still



I'll Be Waiting For You

Here Inside My Heart

I'm The One Who Wants To Love You More

Can't You See I Can Give You


Everything You Need

Let Me Be The One To Love You More



See Me As If You Never Knew

Hold Me So You Can't Let Go

Just Believe In Me

I Will Make You See

All The Things That Your Heart Needs To Know



I'll Be Waiting For You

Here Inside My Heart

I'm The One Who Wants To Love You More

You Will See I Can Give You

Everything You Need

Let Me Be The One To Love You More



Some Way All The Love That We Had Can Be Saved

Whatever It Takes We'll Find A Way




Believe In Me

I Will Make You See

All The Things That Your Heart Needs To Know



I'll Be Waiting For You

Here Inside My Heart

I'm The One Who Wants To Love You More

Can't You See I Can Give You

Everything You Need

Let Me Be The One To Love You More
